        Automatic Sign Language (SL) recognition is an important task in the computer vision community. 
        To build a robust SL recognition system, we need a considerable amount
        of data which is lacking particularly in Indian sign language (ISL). 
        In this paper, we propose a large-scale isolated ISL dataset and a novel SL recognition model based
        on skeleton graph structure. The dataset covers 2,002 daily used common words in the deaf community recorded
        by 20 (10 male and 10 female) deaf adult signers (contains 40033 videos). We propose a SL recognition model
        namely Hierarchical Windowed Graph Attention Network (HWGAT) by utilizing the human upper body skeleton graph
        structure. The HWGAT tries to capture distinctive motions by giving attention to different body parts induced by the
        human skeleton graph structure. The utility of the proposed dataset and the usefulness of our model are evaluated through extensive experiments. 
        We pre-trained the proposed model on the proposed dataset and fine-tuned it across different sign language datasets further boosting
        the performance of 1.10, 0.46, 0.78, and 6.84 percentage points on INCLUDE, LSA64, AUTSL and
        WLASL respectively compared to the existing stateof-the-art skeleton-based models. The proposed dataset
        and the model implementation  will be available at
        https://cs.rkmvu.ac.in/~isl.

          Self-supervised learning has developed rapidly over the last decade and has been applied in many areas of computer vision.
          Decorrelation-based self-supervised pretraining has shown great promise among non-contrastive algorithms, yielding performance
          at par with supervised and contrastive self-supervised baselines. In this work, we explore the decorrelation-based paradigm of self-
          supervised learning and apply the same to learning disentangled stroke features for writer identification. Here we propose a modified
          formulation of the decorrelation-based framework named SWIS which was proposed for signature verification by standardizing the
          features along each dimension on top of the existing framework. We show that the proposed framework outperforms the contemporary
          self-supervised learning framework on the writer identification benchmark and also outperforms several supervised methods as well.
          To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to apply self-supervised learning for learning representations for writer
          verification tasks.

          Earthquakes universally pose threats and risks to all inhabitants of our planet. The
          development of seismic sensors and earthquake alert systems stands as a crucial
          endeavor for society. The inherent nonstationary nature of earthquake signals presents
          a challenge in promptly identifying and classifying events using conventional methods
          such as peak ground displacement and velocity in real-time scenarios. In this research
          paper, we introduce an extraction method focused on first and rapidly (fast) arriving P-
          wave signals, providing parameters for earthquake event characteristics, specifically
          Pd and τc. These identified features serve as benchmarks for evaluating the efficiency
          of various popular machine learning (ML) classifiers in triggering alarms for an
          earthquake early warning system (EEW). Our paper introduces ensemble architectures
          for classification purposes that outperform existing classifiers and even surpass some
          established ensemble classifiers. A significant aspect of this study lies in the successful
          implementation of our proposed machine learning model architecture on the PYNQ Z2
          System on Chip (SoC) FPGA development board, enabling real-world deployment.
          Leveraging the computational capacity of the PYNQ Z2 (SoC) FPGA board allows us
          to analyze signals in terms of data points, facilitating the creation of a real-time alarm
          triggering system.

          Seismic sensing and generation of earthquake alarm is an important application for society at large. 
          In this paper, we propose the strategy of extracting earthquake event features parameters τc and Pd from fast-arriving P-wave signals. 
          The said features are used to explore the performances of some of the popular machine learning (ML) based classifiers to compare their 
          performances in triggering an alarm for the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system. We explored four different ML classifiers namely 
          Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression so that the best can be applied for the 
          EEW alarm generation. We have used publicly available data from the PESMOS platform of IIT-Roorkee in this work.

        The rapid technological advancement in autonomous vehicles due to the 
        development in the field of artificial intelligence as well as rapid improvement in 
        computing hardware has led to immense improvement in self driving technology. 
        The hardware that is being implemented alongside a human driver is already 
        capable of self driving on highways. With the passage of time and the collection of 
        more data by these systems Full Self Driving will soon be a reality. This paper 
        explores an approach to modelling FSD and addresses the industry leading FSD version available. 
        The disruption that will be caused by AVs will be very large. ARK Invest's 
        research shows that the global autonomous MaaS market will exceed $10 trillion in gross revenue by the early 2030s. 
        In the United States, ARK expects the MaaS market to reach over $700 billion in sales by 2030, or roughly 30 times the size of 
        the taxi industry today. The global trucking industry is expected to exceed $6 trillion and AVs will dominate that market. 
        So, the impact of AVs must be foreseen and this paper gives a model for designing an AV network such that it can be implemented in vast scales.

        Improvement in detection and evaluation of brain abnormality and tissues detection is an important task in brain
        image analysis. Diagnosis quality of brain MR of brain images hampered due to the presence of artifacts. Small
        abnormalities detection hampered due to the presence of skull region of the brain.
        Sometimes artifacts and skull have been treated as an abnormality in the automated system, and it hampers the intelligence system. Thus a
        computerized method requires pre-processed image as artifacts and skull removal. Pre-processing makes the image
        segmentation more accurate. In this paper, a pre-processing method for improvement of brain abnormality
        detection and diagnosis has been presented.

      This abstract presents a pioneering dataset tailored explicitly for
      Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems. This dataset comprises a diverse
      collection of seismic data sourced from a network of sensors strategically
      positioned across seismically active regions. The dataset is designed to address
      existing research gaps by providing a standardized and openly accessible resource
      for benchmarking, testing, and advancing EEW technologies. This novel EEW
      dataset comprises multitudinous categories of earthquake early warning data,
      including average period (τc), peak displacement (Pd) and magnitude and also
      different earthquake centers information. The existing dataset has limited diversity
      and size. In this work, we propose a novel dataset for EEW systems which contains
      1050 samples regarding average period (τc), peak displacement (Pd) and
      magnitude and also different earthquake centers information.
